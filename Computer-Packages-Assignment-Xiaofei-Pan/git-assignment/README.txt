The project I am planning to do and explore for the final assignment of this course is my dissertation project. The purpose of my dissertation research is to examine second language learners’ grammatical development of Chinese connectives. Chinese connectives are cohesive devices language users employ to make the clauses and utterances coherent. The independent variable in my study is second language learners’ scores in a grammar test. The dependent variables are psycholinguistic factors related to the Chinese connectives, such as frequency, salience, and contingency. The statistical methods that will be used in this study is a multiple regression analysis, Chi-square test for independence, and ANOVA.

My dissertation is basically quantitative, and requires a lot of knowledge on statistics as well as running statistical analyses using computer packages. That is what i want to learn in this course.

I believe R statistical program will assist me in analyzing quantitative data in my dissertation.

Xiaofei's comments: I think you used dependent and independent variables wrong. The dependent variable (Y)=scores and the independent variables (Xs)=factors.
Could you explain more about which test to answer which RQ?
